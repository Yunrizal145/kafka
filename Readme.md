1. What is Kafka and how does Kafka different from other similar products, especially MQ?
Answer : Kafka is an open-source, distributed streaming platform that can be used for a variety of purposes, including real-time data streaming, event sourcing, and data integration. Kafka is different from other similar products, such as MQ, in a number of ways. Kafka is a distributed system. This means that Kafka can be used to process large amounts of data across multiple servers. MQ is a single-node system, which means that it can only process data on a single server.
Kafka is a streaming platform. This means that Kafka can process data as it is being generated. MQ is a message queuing system, which means that it stores messages until they are processed.
Kafka is fault-tolerant. This means that Kafka can continue to operate even if some of the servers in the cluster fail. MQ is not fault-tolerant.


2. What do you know about below things AND if you have experience working with, please tell us
- Kafka Partitions concept
- Kafka Schema Registry 
- Kafka monitoring tools (anything)
Answer : a. Kafka Partitions, A Kafka partition is a logical division of a topic. Each partition is an ordered, append-only log of messages. Messages within a partition are assigned a sequential ID, and each message is guaranteed to be processed in the order in which it was written.
b. Kafka Schema Registry, The Kafka Schema Registry is a central repository for storing and managing schema definitions for Kafka topics. The Schema Registry allows developers to define and manage the schema for their data, which can be used to ensure data consistency and compatibility across applications.
c. Kafka Monitoring Tools, 1. Confluent Control Center: Confluent Control Center is a comprehensive monitoring and management tool provided by Confluent, the company behind Kafka. It offers real-time monitoring, alerting, and diagnostics for Kafka clusters, topics, and consumers. Control Center provides a user-friendly web-based interface with built-in dashboards, metrics, and visualizations.
2. Apache Kafka Manager: Kafka Manager is an open-source web-based tool developed by Yahoo for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters. It provides a simple and intuitive UI to monitor topic status, broker health, and consumer lag. Kafka Manager allows you to perform various administrative tasks like creating topics, modifying configurations, and rebalancing partitions.
